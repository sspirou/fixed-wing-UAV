Bachelor's thesis and personal project aimed at building a fixed-wing UAV w/ on-board detect and avoid system

----------------------------
#### Contents
- `thesis.pdf` contains my senior capstone thesis from my bachelor's degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. This document outlines the design of the UAV and FAA regulations, specifies software stack and hardware compononet choices, and provides cost estimates for the project. Inside this document I discuss neural networks and their application in a computer vision approach to a detect and avoid system for this project.
